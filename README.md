- name the playground file: FirstName_Swift_Assignment_3
- name the repo: FirstName_Swift_Assignment_3
- Create a super class named Ship
- Create a subclass named CruiseShip
- Create a subclass named CargoShip
- Create a subclass named PirateShip
### the classes should have the following details:
## Ship (superclass)
- name
- year
- countryOfOrigin
- add an appropriate initializer
## CruiseShip (subclass)
- maxCapacity
- oceanOfOperation
- currentPassengerCount
- add a method to add a passenger if the ship is not at max capacity
- add a method to print the current passenger count
## CargoShip (subclass)
- maxCargoCapacity
- currentCargoCount
- isInternational
- add a method to add cargo if the ship is not at max capacity
- add a method to print the current cargo count
## PirateShip (subclass)
- maxTreasureCapacity
- currentTreasureCount
- numberOfCannons
- add a method to add treasure if the ship is not at max capacity
- add a method to print the current treasure count
>Create an instance of 1 of the subclasses and using print statements, demonstrate the use of ALL the properties and methods of that class as well as the superclass 🛠 you can do this anyway you like, but all props and methods must be demonstrated 👍
note: when you are adding passengers, cargo, or treasure, you should NOT be able to add more than the max capacity, but the property should not exceed the max capacity 📦 and just work with a quantity of 1 (as in add 1 passenger, 1 cargo, 1 treasure) to make it simple. So just like the vehicle service sample you will need to find a way to see if the passenger, cargo, or treasure count is at max capacity and if it is, do not add the passenger, cargo, or treasure 🤔
